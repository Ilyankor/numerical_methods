# Homework 1

The folder structure should be

```text
.
├── out/
│   ├── 6/
│   └── 7/
├── src/
│   ├── hw1.cpp
│   ├── hw1.f90
│   └── hw1.py
├── make.zsh
└── README.md
```

To build, run `./make.zsh`, which compiles `main`.
Run `main` to execute homework 1.
The information for problem 6 is found in `/out/6/` and similarly for problem 7, `/out/7`.
