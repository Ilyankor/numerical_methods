# Numerical methods

## Update 02-17

Currently a not so organized dump of files.
Will organize once I have more time, but for now, the collection is just to show that I have coded these algorithms.

## About

A collection of numerical methods (mostly from courses I have taken).

These include methods from areas like differential equations, image processing, linear algebra, optimization theory, and root finding.
The corresponding folders are `diffeq`, `image`, `linear`, `opt`, and `roots`.

The file `log.txt` contains more information about the courses and methods.
