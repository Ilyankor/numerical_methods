# Numerical methods

An implementation of all numerical methods learned from courses I have taken.

These include

`diffeq`, `image`, `linear`, `zeros`

`utils` is used only as helper functions for the main functions.

`not_created.txt` shows all the functions used that I have not implemented from scratch.
