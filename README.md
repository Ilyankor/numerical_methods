# Numerical methods

A collection of numerical methods from courses I have taken.

These include methods from areas like differential equations, image processing, linear algebra, optimization, root finding.
The corresponding folders are `diffeq`, `image`, `linear`, `opt`, `roots`.

The file `log.txt` contains more information about the courses and methods.
